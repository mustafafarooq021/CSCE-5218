        "A)Ans) For the best results, train your model on the full dataset so it can fully learn the data’s characteristics. However, if the dataset is too large, you can use a smaller, representative portion to save time while still aiming for good accuracy. A common practice is to split the data, using 80% for training and 20% for testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "B)Ans) The second testing run obtained worse accuracy with a bigger training data (twice the size). This means its not always the size of training data that changes the results. There could be overfitting or underfitting. In this case, the data is being overfitted and accuracy is lower. The hyperparameteres are also factors of change in accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "C)Ans) Not necessarily, By fine tuning the hyperparameters, we could potentially get a higher accuracy but it is never guarenteed. It is always dependent on the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "D)Ans) Training a model for more epochs without adjusting other hyperparameters isn’t always effective. Fine-tuning performance is an iterative process that involves experimenting with different hyperparameter combinations to reach the desired accuracy.\n",
